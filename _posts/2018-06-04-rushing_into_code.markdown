I thought learning to code may be similar to landing in a new culture.  You learn a bit each day, and become more exposed to the nuances of the culture, language, and norms observed.  Until one day you find yourself having internalized the culture to a vast degree in a short time, and the language and the norms come more naturally, on demand.

Well, at least that was what I thought learning Ruby would be like.  So far,  it's been more of a "hills and valleys" learning curve.  One week I thought "Yay! I'm doing so well", the next week I thought, "It's really dark in here...".

Of course, it's just been three weeks since I started learning Ruby.  Bumps are expected.  Although I was surprised that just when I was starting to feel as if I was getting a bit more comfortable writing code for the Tic Tac Toe game labs, I would hit a complete road block.  

What got me to the roadblock was a personal little habit of mine called rushing.  As someone who likes to charge through life at top speed, learning included.  In this case I was missing the whole learning process!  Although I was able to figure out by trial and error what methods to write up til now by trial and error, I didn't understand why the method or code worked. 

Like an autostererogram in reverse, where you saw the image and then totally lost it and can't see it again (has that ever happened to anyone??) . I went back to the drawing board, to pick up the missing puzzle pieces.    

I learned another thing though, learning to code is more enjoyable when your pace allows for learning!
